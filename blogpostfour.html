            <p>As you have probably seen, on the frontpage of this website i've put up an h2 tag saying that this is website is discontinued. </p>
            <p>I am discontinuing this website because its just a mess, and if i were to apply some new code like Vue or tailwind it would probably be quite painful</p>
            <p>This website is also being discontinued because i think its just better to work with something new from scratch rather than going on with this.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I will still leave this website up, but if you want to go check out my new website (under construction 7/31/24) then you can <a href="https://notatree2.github.io/mywebsite2/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            <p>The github to the new website can also be found <a href="https://github.com/notatree2/mywebsite2" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
