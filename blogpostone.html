            <h1 class = "tho3">My first blog</h1>
            

            <p>This is my first blog! And its a story about this website, today on <b>12/29/2023..</b></p>
            <br>
            <br>


            <h1 class = "tho3">What happened?</h1>
            <p>It all started, when i opened my 2nd issue on Github. About how the HTML file name kept replacing the repo name.</p>
            <p>I spent, 4-5 hours looking for a solution to my code, what could possibly be the problem? I had been looking for so long, it had to be something, right??</p>
            <p><b>It was, in fact something i was overlooking.</b></p>
            <p>I had just now figured out, the whole reason why it wasn't working, the whole reason <b>WHY</b> it had never worked, was because of....</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>A SLASH.</h4>
            <p>That is right. It was all because of a slash, all i had to do to fix this entire thing, was to delete a slash. That was it. <b>A SLASH.</b></p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Now, i know this is a weird first blog, but i decided to share it with you because.. Well, it was funny, but really sad. But anyway, thank you for reading, and have a great rest of your day!</p>
